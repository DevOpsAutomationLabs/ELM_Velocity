Each plugin defines an expected record type and communication method. Communication can be uni-directional or bi-directional. To use a plug-in, you must configure an integration. There are multiple ways to configure an integration: - Create an integration definition on the Plugins tab of the Integrations page. - Install the plug-in and then create an integration definition. - Add an integration definition to a value stream JSON file. - Configure a deployment plan task for one of the native integration types.</p> <p></p> <p>In total there are over 45 plugins available.</p> <p>Once configured and as per that plugin\u2019s synchronization timing, Velocity starts a plugin container image, makes the connection with the target application, and retrieves all data changes from the last sync time.
