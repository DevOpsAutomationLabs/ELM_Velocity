These elements typically represent work items/issues, commits, pull requests, builds, deployments, and tests that are collected from many tools making up your delivery pipeline and integrated into Velocity via plugins. Individual elements are represented graphically by small circles, squares, or triangles, depending on the type, providing information from logically related tools, such as issues managed in an ALM solution linked to one\u2019s source control management (SCM) system. How elements are visualized in a DevOps Velocity value stream can be simple to very complex. You are only limited by your knowledge of how to architect a value stream.</p> <p>The pipeline capability enables organizations to drive releases by using application-focused methods. Add applications to logical environments and let DevOps Velocity generate basic release plans required to deploy the applications. Use quality gates to implement an enhanced level of automated governance helping organizations reduce business risk as software change moves through the delivery pipeline to the production environment.</p> <p>DevOps Velocity\u2019s enterprise-scale release management capabilities supports both cloud-native and on-premises deployment. Use DevOps Velocity to move releases through all of your development life-cycle environments including development, testing, and production. Create a predictable schedule of releases for your software applications. Share release statuses with all stakeholders so that they know the schedules, the key milestones, current status, and issues that may delay releases.</p> <p>The Insights view helps organizations to assess the efficiency of product teams and the speed at which they are able to deliver value to the end users. Teams can measure every aspect of the development lifecycle with the supplied charts. Teams can create their own charts with metric definitions and upload custom data to DevOps Velocity using the Application programming interface (API) endpoints. Since data sources also encompass plug-ins and API calls, project data can come from virtually anywhere, including planning and development tools, testing and building applications, and deployment solutions.</p> <p>In this demonstration, you will focus on the Value Stream and Insights views.</p> <p>For more information about DevOps Velocity, visit Velocity's product documentation page.  </p>"},{"location":"demo1/#business-scenarios-covered-by-this-demonstration","title":"Business Scenarios covered by this demonstration:","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#visualize-and-optimize-the-flow-of-work-to-improve-team-productivity","title":"* Visualize and Optimize the flow of work to improve team productivity","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#eliminate-guess-work-and-use-data-to-make-better-investment-decision-for-process-improvement","title":"* Eliminate guess work and use data to make better investment decision for process improvement","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#business-scenario-1-visualize-and-optimize-the-flow-of-work-to-improve-team-productivity","title":"Business Scenario 1 - Visualize and Optimize the flow of work to improve team productivity.","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#11-understanding-the-business-problem","title":"1.1 Understanding the Business Problem","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#12-what-is-a-value-stream","title":"1.2 What is a Value Stream","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#13-working-with-kpis-and-metrics","title":"1.3 Working with KPIs and Metrics","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#14-understanding-velocitys-alert-capabilities","title":"1.4 Understanding Velocity's Alert capabilities","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#15-velocity-and-the-swimlane-view","title":"1.5 Velocity and the Swimlane View","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#business-scenario-2-eliminate-guess-work-and-use-data-to-make-better-investment-decisions-for-process-improvement","title":"Business Scenario 2 - Eliminate guess work and use data to make better investment decisions for process improvement","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#21-understanding-the-business-problem","title":"2.1 Understanding the Business Problem","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#22-adding-the-bottleneck-detection-capability","title":"2.2 Adding the Bottleneck Detection capability","text":""},{"location":"demo1/#23-velocitys-insights-view-working-with-dashboards-and-charts","title":"2.3 Velocity's Insights View - Working with DashBoards and Charts","text":""},{"location":"enable1/","title":"Configuring the integration between DevOps Velocity and ELM","text":""},{"location":"enable1/#topics-covered-in-this-enablement-lab","title":"Topics covered in this Enablement Lab","text":"<pre><code>* Integrate DevOps Velocity with Engineering Workflow Management\n* Integrate DevOps Velocity with Engineering Requirements Management (DOORs NG RM Project)\n* Integrate DevOps Velocity with Engineering Requirements Management (DOORs NG Global Configuration)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"enable1/#adding-the-integration-between-velocity-and-ewm","title":"Adding the integration between Velocity and EWM","text":""},{"location":"enable1/#preparing-rm-projects-reg-mgmt-and-global-configurations-for-integration-with-velocity","title":"Preparing RM projects (reg mgmt and global configurations) for integration with Velocity","text":""},{"location":"enable1/#configuring-the-plugin-to-integrate-velocity-with-erm-doors-ng-req-mgmt-project","title":"Configuring the plugin to integrate Velocity with ERM (DOORs NG req mgmt project)","text":""},{"location":"enable1/#configuring-the-plugin-to-integrate-velocity-with-erm-doors-ng-global-configuration","title":"Configuring the plugin to integrate Velocity with ERM (DOORs NG global configuration)","text":""},{"location":"enable1/#architecting-the-value-stream-aligned-to-the-artifact-workflow","title":"Architecting the value stream aligned to the Artifact Workflow","text":""},{"location":"enable1/#working-with-velocitys-value-stream-map-file","title":"Working with Velocity's value stream map file","text":""}]}
