Each plugin defines an expected record type and communication method. Communication can be uni-directional or bi-directional. To use a plug-in, you must configure an integration. There are multiple ways to configure an integration: - Create an integration definition on the Plugins tab of the Integrations page. - Install the plug-in and then create an integration definition. - Add an integration definition to a value stream JSON file. - Configure a deployment plan task for one of the native integration types.</p> <p></p> <p>In total there are over 45 plugins available.</p> <p>Once configured and as per that plugin\u2019s synchronization timing, Velocity starts a plugin container image, makes the connection with the target application, and retrieves all data changes from the last sync time.

Phases represent important, organizational parts of the value stream, such as \"Planning,\" or \"Development.\" On the Value stream view, processing is done in left-right order. For example, your first phase might be for planning and contain items created in an issue tracking system. Your next phase, used for development, can track source control activity related to the issues, and any builds triggered by the activity. Your final phase, used for deployment, might track the related build artifacts as they move through your testing environments toward production.</p> <p>Phases contain stages that define process flow within a phase. A development phase that integrates a source control tool might contain an In Progress stage followed by In Review and Merged stages. When you customize a value stream, you define the phases and stages and their order.</p> <p>Stages are containers for dots. Dots represent units of work from DevOps Velocity or tools that are integrated into the value stream. Git commits or Jira issues, to take just two, are represented by individual dots. Work items, such as commits and builds, can be combined into individual dots. A dot's position in the value stream conveys important information about the object. Dots in a stage named Merged might represent items merged into Git repositories. An item's shape and color convey information about the item's type and status. A dot outlined in red, for example, might mean the item is past schedule. When dots change state, they move to new stages in near-real time. Finally, when you click on a dot, the displayed card provides information about the work items, including their history, and provides links to associated tools.</p> <p>For this purposes of this enablement exercise, a very simple approach was followed in archtitecting the value stream. The phases and stages were mapped to the artifact workflows defined in EWM showing only the current state of the user stories, defects, and tasks.</p> <p></p> <p>Reviewing the Value Stream Map image, notice the following: 1. Definition of the four phases - Open, In Progress, Approval, Released 2. Within the Open phase there are two stages named New and ReOpened 3. The query statement in the Open stage instructs Velocity to display all work items which are currently in a New state. 4. The query statement in the ReOpened stage instructs Velocity to display only work items of type Defect which in an ReOpened state. 5. And finally the target stanza on each stage helps to visualize the next stage that a work item could be displayed in.</p> <p>For the purposes of this enablement exercise, a template has been created to help bootstrap creation and configuration of the value stream.</p> <p>If you would like to review the entire VSM template, open the link in a new browser tab: EWM VS map Template </p> <p>Return to List of Enablement Topics </p>"},{"location":"enablement/#working-with-ewm_1","title":"Working with EWM","text":"<p>To visualize EWM artifacts as \"DOTS\" in a DevOps Velocity value stream, three basic steps must happen: 1.
