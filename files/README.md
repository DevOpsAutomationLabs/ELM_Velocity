To boostrap configuring Value Streams in DevOps Velocity, two vsm map (json files) have been templated, based on the default workflows available in EWM (story, defect, task) and ERM (all artifact types), and have been provided for import as part of the Value Stream creation process presented in the Enablement exercises.

### EWM Value Stream - EWM_defaultWorkflow-vsm.json
### ERM Value Stream - DOORs_defaultWorkflow-vsm.json
