# Files

To boostrap in configuring Value Streams in DevOps Velocity, two vsm map (json files) have been templated, based on the default workflows available in EWM (story, defect, task) and ERM (all artifact types), and made available for import as part of the Value Stream creation process.

[EWM Value Stream - EWM_defaultWorkflow-vsm.json](../EWM Value Stream - EWM_defaultWorkflow-vsm.json)
[ERM Value Stream - DOORs_defaultWorkflow-vsm.json](../ERM Value Stream - DOORs_defaultWorkflow-vsm.json)
